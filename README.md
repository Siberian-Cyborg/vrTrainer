# vrTrainer
VR application created using Unity. Point of this project was to verify the feasibilty of VR for training cabin crew to potentially safe on very expensive mockup planes and training facilities.
Due to a NDA I cannot disclose the code for the application. All I can do is show a video of the resulting prototype. In case you have question concerning the project and/or the code hit me up on twitter. You can find my contact thtru my website linked on github.
