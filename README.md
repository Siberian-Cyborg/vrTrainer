# vrTrainer
A VR application created using Unity. The point of this project was to verify the feasibilty of VR for training cabin crew to potentially safe on very expensive mockup planes and training facilities.
Due to a NDA I cannot disclose the code for the application. All I can do is show a video of the resulting prototype. In case you have question concerning the project and/or the code hit me up on twitter.

I have recorded the video many years after the project was finished. The Unity version the code was originally written in is already depreciated, wherefore the video shows funny error messages. Unfortunately I had no VR headset at hand so I had to use my mouse and keyboard for the recording. Nonetheless,  I hope I could still convey the point of this project.
